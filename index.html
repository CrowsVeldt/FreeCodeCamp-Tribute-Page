                    <h2><b>Early Years</b></h2>
                    <p class="text">Rogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario the eldest son of Nathan Allison "Al" and Valerie Rogers (née Bushell), two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. Although Rogers was raised in Woodburn, Ontario (a community in the easternmost part of Hamilton), he often spent summers visiting family in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia. It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the Maritimes, an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development.</p>

                    <h2><b>Music</b></h2>
                    <p class="text"> He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak. He received his first guitar, hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age. He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the country and western tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers. Throughout his childhood, he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother Garnet, six years his junior.
                    <br> <br>
                    By the time that Rogers was attending Saltfleet High School in Stoney Creek, he started to meet other young people interested in folk music, although at this time he was also dabbling in rock and roll, singing and playing bass guitar in garage bands such as "Stanley and the Living Stones" and "The Hobbits".
                    <br> <br>
                    Rogers' songs often had a Celtic feel which was due, in part, to his frequent use of DADGAD guitar tuning. He regularly used the 12-string guitar in performance. His best-known pieces include "Northwest Passage", "Barrett's Privateers", "The Mary Ellen Carter", "Make and Break Harbour", "The Idiot", "The Field Behind the Plow", "Lies", "Fogarty's Cove", "White Squall", and "Forty-Five Years".</p>

                    <h2><b>Legacy</b></h2>
                    <p class="text">Rogers left a profound impact on Canadian music and culture. He was an early popularizer of traditional Celtic music, helping to pave the way for widespread acceptance of such artists as Spirit of the West, The Rankins, and Great Big Sea. He was also a music industry pioneer whose success as an independent artist inspired others and contributed to the development of Canada’s thriving independent music scene.
                    <br>
                    Rogers’s greatest impact, though, is as a songwriter. Dozens of artists around the world have recorded his music, while songs like “Barrett’s Privateers,” “The Mary Ellen Carter” and “Northwest Passage” are modern folk classics. Although Rogers still gets little radio play outside of the Maritimes and the CBC, his work has gradually filtered into the vernacular.
